Typically, those two goals are at conflict \u2013 realistic rendering often has performance penalties that can compromise the real-time requirement. A compromise is usually required w.r.t. the design goal. Geometric Realism \u00b6 Geometric realism refers to a graphical object that has a close geometric resemblance w.r.t. the real-world object being simulated. A practical reason for geometric realism is its application in virtual prototyping , which requires geometric accuracy up to a certain threshold. Example: usage of 3D reconstruction of CT/NMR scans for patients for reconstructive surgery to help the surgeons to visualize the patient's situation. If the geometry is insufficiently accurate then it may be misleading and cause negative contribution. Illumination Realism \u00b6 Illumination is an important consideration for visual prototyping as well \u2013 lighting certainly affects how objects present to observers. Example: in architecture design lighting often is part of functional requirements, e.g. so users won't trip because of poorly illuminated obstacles. Correct lighting needs to take into account interreflections between surfaces of objects in the scene (also refraction in case of translucent objects), and not only the impact of light sources on individual objects in isolation. Considering impact of light sources on individual objects in isolation is local illumination . Global illumination considers a correct computation of lighting distribution within a VE, taking into account inter-object reflections and refractions. Also referred to as photo-realism , to simulate those taken by actual cameras to the point of being indistinguishable. Behaviour Realism \u00b6 A graphical object may not necessarily be geometrically nor illuminatively realistic, but its behaviour can be sufficiently realistic to elicit emotional responses from the observer. Example: cartoons, often not \"real\" geometrically or illuminatively, but still can trigger emotional responses \u2013 sometimes even by distortions of \"reality\" on purposes, such as exaggeration. Caricatures, Impressionism and Iconic Representations \u00b6 Sometimes graphical works rely on external contextual information that is not intrinsically contained within the information available to the VE, but needs the observer to \"piece them together.\" Tension Between Realism and Real-Time \u00b6 The ideal \"realism\" in CG refers to geometric, behavioural and illumination realism, but are increasing difficult and come at cost of real-time performance, but VR needs real-time performance to function. Real-Time \u00b6 Computers generate illusion of movement and changes on a display via the same techniques as animated cartoons or movies (aka moving pictures), by rapidly displaying many images in a correctly-ordered contiguous sequence many times per second. Each of such image is a frame . The frame rate is defined as the number of images displayed per second, and is measured in Hertz ( \\(\\text{Hz}\\) ). \\(60\\ \\text{Hz}\\) imply \\(60\\) images displayed per second. If the frame rate is sufficiently fast, the human observer cannot tell that individual frames are being rendered and swapped, but will see a continously changing scene. A real-time requirement imposes restrictions on computer resources, such as disk access, network bandwidth, memory and display. This requires compromises to be made. Some aspects of illumination must be sacrificed. In a complex scene, often not possible to display each object with full geometric realism.

Accomodation \u00b6 Accomodation is the process of adjusting the lens to bring points in the scene into focus \u2013 this gives rise to effects such as motion blue and depth-of-field. Convergence \u00b6 Convergence is the process of when eyes rotate inwards to focus on objects that are nearby and rotate outwards for further objects.

Many Cues for 3Dness \u00b6 Convergence and Parallaxes \u00b6 When you shut one eye, convergence still operates which can be a powerful indication of depth .

Unit Vector \u00b6 A unit vector \\(\\vu{v}\\) has the same direction as vector \\(\\vb{v}\\) but ensures that \\(\\abs{\\vu{v}} = 1\\) . \\(\\vu{v}\\) can be derived from \\(\\vb{v}\\) by normalizing \\(\\vb{v}\\) via \\[ \\vu{v} = \\frac{\\vb{v}}{\\abs{\\vb{v}}} \\] Inner (Dot) Product of Two Vectors \u00b6 Given two vectors \\(\\vb{v}_1 = [x_1, y_1, z_1], \\vb{v}_2 = [x_2, y_2, z_2]\\) then their dot product \\(\\vb{v}_1 \\bullet \\vb{v}_2\\) is given by \\[ \\vb{v}_1 \\bullet \\vb{v}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\\\ z_1 \\end{bmatrix} \\bullet \\begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ z_2 \\end{bmatrix} = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2 \\] If we normalize each of the vectors \\(\\vb{v}_1, \\vb{v}_2\\) to give \\(\\vu{v}_1, \\vu{v}_2\\) , then \\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vb{v}_1 \\bullet \\vb{v}_2}{\\abs{\\vb{v}_1} \\abs{\\vb{v}_2}} = \\vu{v}_1 \\bullet \\vu{v}_2 \\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between \\(\\vb{v}_1\\) and \\(\\vb{v}_2\\) . The dot product is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

Cross Product \u00b6 Given two vectors \\(\\vb{a} = [a_1, a_2, a_3], \\vb{b} = [b_1, b_2, b_3]\\) then their cross product \\(\\vb{a} \\times \\vb{b}\\) is given by \\[ \\begin{align} \\vb{a} \\cross \\vb{b} &= \\mqty| \\vu{i} & \\vu{j} & \\vu{k} \\\\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\\\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 | \\\\ &= \\mqty| a_2 & a_3 \\\\ b_2 & b_3 | \\vu{i} - \\mqty| a_1 & a_3 \\\\ b_1 & b_3 | \\vu{j} + \\mqty| a_1 & a_2 \\\\ b_1 & b_2 | \\vu{k} \\\\ &= (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\vu{i} - (a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1) \\vu{j} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\vu{k} \\end{align} \\] An property of this cross product is given by \\[ \\abs{\\vb{a} \\times \\vb{b}} = \\abs{\\vb{a}} \\abs{\\vb{b}} \\sin(\\theta) \\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the two vectors.
